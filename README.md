**A belt conveyor system with foreign body detection and alert system.**

***

This project makes use of an Arduino Uno R3 to control a conveyor belt based on the height of the objects placed on the belt, and displays the number of accepted objects on a 1602 LCD screen.

If you do not have the `sensors` library installed, get it using [www.github.com/chima-okwara/sensors](www.github.com/chima-okwara/sensors)
